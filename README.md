1. I was not able to finish the challenge.
2. Only the Post method was developed but with limitations (number of daughter in the JSON tree)
3. The Get method was not developed for lack of time
4. Most of the difficulties faced were due to the mandatory use of a relational database on a many-to-many self relations problem (would be simplified by using NoSQL)
5. Super interesting problem which allowed me to use some technology I've been wanting to try for a while (Prisma IO).


In spite of the outcome, THANKS PIPEDRIVE for such an amazing experience!
